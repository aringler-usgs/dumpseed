.SH NAME
seedfilter - filter records from a SEED stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B seedfilter
.B -x
.B -i
.B -S
.B -v
.B -b 
.IR size
.B -s
.IR selectfile
.B -t
.IR types

.SH DESCRIPTION
Filter SEED records from standard in to standard out, 
copying only those records which meet the include/exclude 
rules and that of a select file (optional).
.PP
The different flags specify the methods for record selection.
.TP
.B -x
Output data to the standard output in LISS-2 (extended mode).
Extended mode is comprised simply of SEED records enclosed
in a representation which automatically specifies the source, format,
and size of the data.  If this flag is not used, data will be
send to standard output in the same format (raw SEED or
extended mode that came in).
.TP
.B -S
Output data records in raw SEED.  This is only used to
override the format of data that is coming into standard in
(as opposed to -x).
.TP
.B -v
Emit diagnostic messages to standard error.  Otherwise 
.IR seedfilter
will be quiet.
.TP
.B -b
.IR size
.br
Override the default record sizes.  This corresponds with the
SEED
.I logical record size.
The default record size for files is 512.
.TP
.B -s
.IR selectfile
.br
Allows complex selection to be performed on the input data
stream.  Combinations of Network, Station, Location, Channel
and time-range can be used.  Please see the 
.BR selectfile (4)
manual page for information on how to construct a select file.
If 
.IR seedfilter
is connecting to a bi-directional LISS-2 port, the filter will
be sent up the server.  This can greatly lower the network load
by transmitting only the desired data, instead of sending it
all and throwing away undesired data at the client end.
.TP
.B -i
Invert the sense of the select file.  Records which match the
select file are 
.B removed
instead of kept.
.TP
.B -t
.IR types
.br
A list of record types that will be 
.IR retained
when the data is filtered.  Defaults to 'D'.  You can specify
other types (from the ASCII SEED header types).
.TP
.B -r
.IR types
.br
Specify a list of record types that will be
.IR removed
when the data is filtered.  Any 
.IR retain
settings (the -t option) are ignored if this is set.
.SH EXAMPLES
Copy standard out to in - remove all but 'D' type records.
.LP
.RS
.B "example% seedfilter <in >out"
.RE
.LP
Copy standard out to in - remove only 'A' type records.
.LP
.RS
.B "example% seedfilter -r A <in >out"
.LP
.RE
Copy standard out to in - Use a select file - copy only 'D' records.
.LP
.RS
.B "example% seedfilter -s select.dat <in >out"
.RE
.SH HISTORY
.IR seedfilter
was extracted from 
.BR dumpseed(1)
to form a standalone program to permit
users to receive raw seed from a LISS.
